# Football-players-detection
Various tools, scripts and research made for football players detection and extraction from one static video

## Description
Project is for master thesis research purposes but I thought some of functions may be usefull so made it public.

### Purpose
The main purpose of this project is to research various techniques and ways of detecting players. Ideally program would recognize players, team they belong to and track them after some initialisation.


## Getting Started
At this moment most of functions are adapted to particural video. You need to make some changes in order to work it for you (Check Usage section)
